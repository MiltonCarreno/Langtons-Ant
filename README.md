# [Langton's Ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant)

This is an implementation of Chris Lantong's famous two-dimensional cellular automaton.
Its simple rules show that simplicity is fertile ground for complex, and arguably beautiful, behavior.
This incredibly unassuming programm is an [Universal Turing Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Turing_machine).
